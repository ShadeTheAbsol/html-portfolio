<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am primarily a game developer and in the process of learning web development. I have spent several years studying the Unity game engine while also attempting to learn the Unreal game engine. My skills are primarily focused as a C# game programmer in Unity and level design.</p>

<p>I am great at getting along with others and have a dedicated passion for learning. I enjoy many things and have learned a lot on game development just through playing games. A majority of my interests lie in indie games in particular.</p>

<p>My main project that I created for learning purposes involved a wolf needing to traverse the spirit realms. It went by the name Okuri Inu and the Spirit Realms and required the player to pass several tests set by spirit animals. It is a 2D game and has gameplay features such as pushing blocks, elemental breaths for puzzle solving, teleporting and even wall climbing.</p>
